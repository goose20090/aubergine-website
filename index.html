      <h1> Aubergine Peanut Stew</h1>
      <h2>Ingredients (for 4-5?)</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>2-3 aubergines (depending on size)</li>
          <li>3 onions</li>
          <li>2-3 garlic cloves</li>
          <li>1-2 tbsp paprika</li>
          <li>1 tbsp ground coriander</li>
          <li>1 tbsp dried thyme</li>
          <li>2-3 tins plum tomatoes <br> Optional: additional cherry tomatoes to roast in oven and add to sauce in substitue of some tinned plum tomatoes</li>
          <li>Encona scotch bonnet chilli sauce (1-2tsp? careful with it friends)</li>
          <li>Veg stock (tsp bouillon, or 1 cube)</li>
          <li>Salt/pepper (if you have white pepper that is really nice instead of black)</li>
          <li>Peanut butter (smooth is best)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>To Serve</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Yoghurt (mandatory)</li>
        <li>Encona (mandatory)</li>
        <li>Greens (roated broccoli, as we know, is delicious - if you can be arsed with okra that is also great roasted or fried alongside this)</li>
        <li>Carb (flatbreads/white rice/brown rice)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Method</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Chop aubergine and onion into large chunks</li>
        <li>(optional)- salt aubergine and leave in colander over sink. This makes it cook easier and more soft/sliky in main dish.</li>
        <li>Fry for 15-20 mins, ideally in lots of oil, and adding salt and pepper, until both are browned and softened</li>
        <li>Add garlic, paprika, thyme, ground coriander, fry around until aromatic (1-2 mins)</li>
        <li>Add tinned tomatoes (I prefer whole plum tomatoes and then squidging them with my hands out of the tin, because I am a child, but normal chopped will do)</li>
        <li></li>
      </ol>
